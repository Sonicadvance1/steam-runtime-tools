libcapsule provides a few tools to help initialise a proxy library project:

The simplest route to a [hopefully] working project is as follows:

  ~$ capsuletools=$(pkg-config --variable=libexecdir capsule)
  ~$ $capsuletools/capsule-init-project libGL.so.1 /host 

  Generating project for /host : libGL.so.1 1.2.0 proxy
  Creating project directory libGL-proxy
  Working in /home/vivek/src/valve/dlmopen/libGL-proxy
  Extracting dynamic symbols from /host : libGL.so.1
  Preparing proxy source files
  Initialising configure.ac
  Initialising Makefile.am
  Bootstrapping autoconf templates for libGL.so.1
  Running initial configuration
  autoreconf: Entering directory `.'
  autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gettext
  autoreconf: running: aclocal --force 
  autoreconf: configure.ac: tracing
  autoreconf: running: libtoolize --copy --force
  libtoolize: putting auxiliary files in `.'.
  libtoolize: copying file `./ltmain.sh'
  libtoolize: putting macros in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR, `m4'.
  libtoolize: copying file `m4/libtool.m4'
  libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltoptions.m4'
  libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltsugar.m4'
  libtoolize: copying file `m4/ltversion.m4'
  libtoolize: copying file `m4/lt~obsolete.m4'
  libtoolize: Consider adding `-I m4' to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am.
  autoreconf: running: /usr/bin/autoconf --force
  autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Autoheader
  autoreconf: running: automake --add-missing --copy --force-missing
  Makefile.am: installing './depcomp'
  autoreconf: Leaving directory `.'
  /home/x/src/valve/dlmopen/libGL-proxy is ready for ./configure, \
      see README for details

This will set up a project to build a proxy for libGL.so.1, expected
to be found in a foreign filesystem tree mounted at /host.

The target library (the real libGL.so.1) must be present in a well-formed
tree mounted at /host at the point at which you run this command.

If you ever make changes which require the proxy librayr source files
to be regenerated (changing the foreign tree location from /host or
altering the list of symbols to export) then the foreign tree must
likewise be present.

However you do not need the tree to be present to build the library itself
once the project has been initialised.

The layout of the project will be as follows:

  ./
  ./shim/
  ./shim/libGL.so.c.shared
  ./shim/libGL.so.c.dlopen
  ./shim/libGL.so.symbols
  ./shim/libGL.so.c.excluded
  ./configure
  ./m4/…
  ./autom4te.cache/…
  ./README
  ./install-sh
  ./depcomp
  ./config.status
  ./capsule-shim.mk
  ./config.guess
  ./Makefile
  ./preconfigure.log
  ./Makefile.am
  ./configure.ac
  ./config.sub
  ./aclocal.m4
  ./missing
  ./config.log
  ./libtool
  ./ltmain.sh
  ./compile
  ./Makefile.in

A few of these files are of immediate interest:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
preconfigure.log:

  This records the initial bootstrapping step of the project, which uses
  autoconf to set up the build system from libcapsule's templates.

  If things are working, there's little of interest here, but if something's
  not quite right there may be important clues recorded here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile.am

  A few important details are recorded here:

  CAPSULE_LIBRARY - The stub of the library name (‘GL’ in this case).

  CAPSULE_VERSION - The version number of the poxy library we should build
                    defaults to the same version as the library in /host
                    if that can be deduced from the /host tree.

                    Only the major version (major.minor.sub) needs to match,
                    otherwise you may change this as desired.

  CAPSULE_TREE    - The location of the foreign tree.

                    You may change this, but doing so requires the source
                    to be regenerated, which requires the new foreign tree
                    to be present.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
shim/libGL.so.c.excluded

  This file should contain a list of libraries which should _NOT_
  be picked up from the /host tree and isolated in the capsule,
  one per line.

  The following library is always considered to be excluded by
  the code generator, so there's no need to add it explicitly:

  libdl.so.2

  Other libraries which you may need to add, depending on the exact
  API presented by the proxied library, are:

  libc.so.6          - if memory allocated inside the target library
                       is freed by the main program, or similar.

  libpthread.so.0    - if thread synchronisation or similar occurs
  libpthread-2.19.so   both inside the proxied library and your main
                       program AND the two need to be aware of one
                       another.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
shim/libGL.so.c.shared

  This file should contain any extra libraries whose symbols should _also_ be
  exported from the capsule, along with those from the main library libGL.so.

  It will generally be empty, but in libGL.so's case it must contain:

  libxcb.so.1
  libxcb-glx.so.0
  libxcb-dri2.so.0
  libxcb-dri3.so.0
  libxcb-present.so.0
  libxcb-sync.so.1
  libX11.so
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
shim/libfoo.so.c.dlopen

  If your library needs any special handling of dlopen() calls you will need to
  implement a function with the following signature and name:

  static void *_dlopen (const char *filename, int flags)
  {
    ⋮
  }

and put it in this file. A default wrapper which should work for most
libraries is generated here by the capsule-init-project tool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's it - you should be ready to:

  ./configure
  make

Your generated capsule libraries will be in .libs,
and you can use ‘make install’ et al, as usual, to install them.

Note that you should be careful about this, as you are deliberately
generating a library which has the same name as a ‘real’ one, which
is very much not a normal situation, and carelessness here could break
your system.
