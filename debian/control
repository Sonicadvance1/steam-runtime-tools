Description: Segregated run-time linker library
 libcapsule is a helper library used to implement segregated run-time
 dynamic linking proxy libraries - used (for example) to load a library
 that has dependencies incompatible with the regular libraries that are
 part of the host OS, such as an incompatible libstdc++ version.
 .
 This package contains the run-time component(s) of libcapsule.
