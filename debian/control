Section: libdevel
Depends:
 libc6-dev,
 libcapsule0 (= ${binary:Version}),

Description:
 libcapsule is a helper library used to implement segregated run-time
 dynamic linking proxy libraries - used (for example) to load a library
 that has dependencies incompatible with the regular libraries that are
 part of the host OS, such as an incompatible libstdc++ version.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to build libcapsule proxy libraries.
