  * Check whether GLX drivers can actually draw to an X11 window.
    This provides a more thorough test than wflinfo.
  * Check whether Vulkan drivers can actually draw to an X11 window.
    This provides a more thorough test than vulkaninfo.
  * Fix reporting of timeouts in JSON

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Build selected executables with a RPATH.
    This allows a copy of steam-runtime-system-info bundled in the
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH Steam Runtime to find the copies of
    libsteam-runtime-tools and libjson-glib in the same Runtime.
  * Look for wflinfo, vulkaninfo and libraries adjacent to
    libsteam-runtime-tools
  * Use g++-4.8 if default g++ is older
  * Build shaders using glslangValidator
  * Fix many compiler warnings
  * check-vulkan: Add basic command-line parsing with --help
  * Add --version argument to most executables
  * check-vulkan: Optionally make the window visible
  * Look for -check-vulkan in default helpers path, not in PATH
  * check-vulkan: Look for shaders in the correct place when installed
  * Add build-dependencies for check-gl

  [ Ludovico de Nittis ]
  * Add support for libraries with hidden dependencies
  * Detect GLX and EGL graphics library vendor (either GLVND,
    legacy non-GLVND Mesa, legacy non-GLVND NVIDIA, or other non-GLVND)

  * locale: fix leaked SrtLocale

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * graphics, library: Capture stderr from the checks
    and include it in their JSON output
  * locale: Check for the necessary files to generate more locales.
    This issue flag is known to appear on Arch Linux and its derivatives,
    which don't normally install /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED.
  * Generate autocleanup functions if GLib (or libglnx) supports it.
    This is not directly useful in steam-runtime-tools because we only
    require an older GLib, but is useful when reused in pressure-vessel.
  * Add some missing precondition checks
  * Assert we are not setuid before looking at the environment
  * graphics: Add EGL and Vulkan ICD enumeration
  * Distinguish between the Steam installation (root) and data paths.
    We had previously mixed these up: it isn't particularly obvious since
    they are usually the same. See the documentation for details.
