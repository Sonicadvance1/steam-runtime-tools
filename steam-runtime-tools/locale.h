 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_INTERNAL_ERROR: An internal error of some kind has occurred
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_DEFAULT_MISSING: `setlocale (LC_ALL, "")` fails.
 *  This indicates that environment variables like LANGUAGE and LC_ALL
 *  are set to values that do not match the locales available on the
 *  filesystem.
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_DEFAULT_NOT_UTF8: `setlocale (LC_ALL, "")` succeeds
 *  but results in a a non-UTF-8 locale. This often breaks program and
 *  library assumptions, particularly around interoperable filenames.
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_C_UTF8_MISSING: `setlocale (LC_ALL, "C.UTF-8")`
 *  does not succeed, or succeeds but results in a non-UTF-8 locale.
 *  This locale is available in Debian and Fedora derivatives, and is a
 *  UTF-8 equivalent of the standard C/POSIX locale. It has been proposed
 *  for inclusion in upstream glibc, but as of 2019 it is not available on
 *  all Linux systems.
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_EN_US_UTF8_MISSING: `setlocale (LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8")`
 *  does not succeed, or succeeds but results in a non-UTF-8 locale.
 *  This locale is not generally guaranteed to exist on Linux systems,
 *  but some games and software packages assume that it does.
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_I18N_SUPPORTED_MISSING: The `SUPPORTED` file
 *  listing supported locales was not found in the expected location.
 *  This indicates that either locale data is not installed, or this
 *  operating system does not put it in the expected location.
 *  The Steam Runtime might be unable to generate extra locales if needed.
 * @SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_I18N_LOCALES_EN_US_MISSING: The `locales/en_US` file
 *  describing the USA English locale was not found in the expected
 *  location.
 *  This indicates that either locale data is not installed, or this
 *  operating system does not put it in the expected location, or only
 *  a partial set of locale source data is available.
 *  The Steam Runtime will be unable to generate extra locales if needed.
 *
 * A bitfield with flags representing potential problems with locales, or
 * %SRT_LOCALE_ISSUES_NONE (which is numerically zero) if no problems
 * were detected.
 *
 * In general, more bits set means more problems.
