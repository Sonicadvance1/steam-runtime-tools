/**
 * SrtX86FeatureFlags:
 * @SRT_X86_FEATURE_NONE: None of the features listed here are supported
 * @SRT_X86_FEATURE_X86_64: The CPU supports the "Long mode", where an OS can
 *  access 64-bit instructions and registers (i.e. x86-64 architecture),
 *  indicated by `lm` in Linux `/proc/cpuinfo`
 * @SRT_X86_FEATURE_SSE3: The CPU supports the SSE3 extension (Streaming SIMD
 *  Extensions 3, also known as Prescott New Instructions), indicated by
 *  `pni` in Linux `/proc/cpuinfo`
 * @SRT_X86_FEATURE_CMPXCHG16B: The CPU supports the CMPXCHG16B instruction,
 *  indicated by `cx16` in Linux `/proc/cpuinfo`
 * @SRT_X86_FEATURE_UNKNOWN: An unknown CPU feature was encountered when
 *  loading a report
 *
 * A bitfield with flags representing the features that the CPU supports, or
 * %SRT_X86_FEATURE_NONE (which is numerically zero) if none of the features
 * we checked are supported.
 *
 * In general, more bits set means more instructions are supported, with the
 * only exception for %SRT_X86_FEATURE_UNKNOWN.
 *
 * At the time of writing, the Steam client requires %SRT_X86_FEATURE_X86_64,
 * %SRT_X86_FEATURE_SSE3 and %SRT_X86_FEATURE_CMPXCHG16B.
