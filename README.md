pressure-vessel â€” tools to put Steam in containers
==================================================

pressure-vessel is a bit like a simplified version of Flatpak for Steam games.

Use cases
---------

### Protecting `$HOME`

If we change the meaning of `/home` for a game to be a fake
app-specific directory, then the game can't write random files in unknown
subdirectories of $HOME, and we can be reasonably sure that uninstalling
a game removes all of its files. (As a side benefit, this could make it
easier to be sure that all the necessary files have been selected for
Steam Cloud Sync, because we could prevent the game writing anywhere
that won't be synchronised, other than /tmp or similar.)

### Using an alternative runtime

We can get a more predictable library stack than the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`-based Steam Runtime by making an alternative runtime
available over `/usr`, `/lib*`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, analogous to Flatpak
runtimes, using some or all of the host system's graphics stack.

A future goal is to use [libcapsule][] to avoid the library dependencies
of the host system's graphics stack influencing the libraries loaded by
games, particularly libstdc++. This is not yet implemented.

Building a relocatable install
------------------------------

To make the built version compatible with older systems, you will need
an environment based on Ubuntu 12.04 'precise' or Debian 8 'jessie'.
SteamRT 1 'scout' or SteamRT 1.5 'heavy' should be suitable.
SteamOS 2 'brewmaster' is not suitable, because its amd64 and i386
linux-libc-dev packages are not currently co-installable.

The most straightforward method is to have a prebuilt version of
libcapsule-tools-relocatable:amd64 and libcapsule-tools-relocatable:i386
in your build environment. For example, you could do the build in a
SteamRT 1 'scout' or SteamRT 1.5 'heavy' Docker image that has those
packages already. Then you can just do:

    make

Or, if your build environment has those packages available but
uninstalled, you can unpack them with `dpkg-deb -x` and use something
like:

    make relocatabledir=./usr/lib/libcapsule/relocatable

Alternatively, build a Debian source package (`.dsc`, `.debian.tar.*`,
`.orig.tar.*` for libcapsule 0.20190402.0 or later, which will require
autoconf-archive 20160916-1~bpo8+1 or later if you are building from git.
Put it in the top-level directory of `pressure-vessel`, for example:

    dcmd cp ../build-area/libcapsule_0.20190402.0-0co1.dsc .

After that, the simplest way is (again) to do the build already inside
a suitable container:

    make

Alternatively, you can use `bubblewrap` to enter a sysroot prepared
using [debos][] and [qemu-system-x86_64][qemu]. If
you have all those, you can just run:

    make -C sysroot

which will automatically build and use the sysroot. (This sysroot
won't have libcapsule-tools-relocatable, so you will need a
`libcapsule_*.dsc` or the `relocatabledir` variable, as above.)

Alternatively, prepare a Debian jessie sysroot with `deb`
and `deb-src` sources and an `i386` foreign architecture (see
`sysroot/configure-sources.sh`), all the packages listed in
`sysroot/install-dependencies.sh`, and optionally
libcapsule-tools-relocatable. Then use:

    make -C sysroot sysroot=/path/to/sysroot

or compress a similar chroot into a gzipped tar file (containing `./etc`,
`./usr` and so on, as used by [lxc][] and [pbuilder][]) and use:

    make -C sysroot tarball=/path/to/tarball.tar.gz

Whichever method you use, binaries and source code end up in
`relocatable-install/` which can be copied to wherever you want.

Instructions for testing
------------------------

* Install Steam and some games. Convenient choices for a reasonably
  small free-to-play game on various engines include:

    - Floating Point (game ID 302380)
        - very small/quick to install, works OK on weak hardware
        - UnityPlayer 4.3.4f1
    - Life is Strange, episode 1 (319630)
        - Unreal Engine 3
    - Team Fortress 2 (440)
        - Source engine
    - Unturned (304930)
        - UnityPlayer 5.5.3f1

* Unpack `pressure-vessel-`*VERSION*`-bin.tar.gz` (or `...-bin+src.tar.gz`)
  in some convenient place (I used `/opt/pressure-vessel`, but a
  production deployment in Steam would more realistically use somewhere
  under `~/.steam` or `~/.local/share/Steam`):

    - be a user who can sudo

            $ cd /opt
            $ sudo mkdir pressure-vessel
            $ sudo chown $(id -nu) pressure-vessel
            $ tar --strip-components=1 -C pressure-vessel -xzvf ~/pressure-vessel-*-bin.tar.gz
            $ chmod -R a+rX pressure-vessel

* Launch a game once without pressure-vessel

* Configure the launch options for the chosen game:

    - be the Steam user, possibly via sudo -u steam -s

            $ nano ~/.steam/steam/userdata/[0-9]*/config/localconfig.vdf

    - navigate to UserLocalConfigStore/Software/Valve/Steam/Apps/*game ID*
    - below LastPlayed, add:

            "LaunchOptions" "/opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-unruntime -- %command%"

    - restart Steam (on SteamOS use `sudo systemctl restart lightdm`)

        - TODO: Is there a scriptable way to make Steam edit `localconfig.vdf`
            itself, or to make it reload an edited `localconfig.vdf`?

* Run the game. If successful, `pstree -pa` will look something like this:

        |-SteamChildMonit,13109 -tenfoot -steamos -enableremotecontrol
        |   `-sh,13110 -c...
        |       `-pressure-vessel,13111 /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-wrap...
        |           `-bwrap,13132 --new-session --setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH...
        |               `-Floating Point.,13133

* To use a runtime instead of the host system, use:

        /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-unruntime --runtime=$HOME/some-runtime -- %command%

    The runtime can be either:

    - A merged `/usr` containing `bin/bash`, `lib/ld-linux.so.2`,
      `bin/env`, `share/locale`, `lib/python2.7` and so on

    - A Flatpak runtime such as
      `~/.local/share/flatpak/runtime/com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Platform/x86_64/scout_beta/active/files`,
      for example produced by [flatdeb][] (this is a special case of a
      merged `/usr`). For example, as the user that will run Steam:

            $ flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify smcv-flatdeb https://people.collabora.com/~smcv/flatdeb/repo
            $ flatpak --user install smcv-flatdeb com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Platform/x86_64/scout_beta
            $ ln -fns ~/.local/share/flatpak/runtime/com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Platform/x86_64/scout_beta/active/files \
                ~/scout_beta-runtime

        and then set the launch options to:

            /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-unruntime --runtime=$HOME/scout_beta-runtime -- %command%

    - A sysroot containing `bin/bash`, `lib/ld-linux.so.2`,
      `usr/bin/env`, `usr/share/locale`, `usr/lib/python2.7` and so on,
      optionally with `bin`, `lib` etc. being symlinks into `usr`

    In this mode, graphics drivers come from the host system, while
    their dependencies (notably glibc and libstdc++) come from either
    the host system or the runtime, whichever appears to be newer. This
    is currently hard-coded in `pressure-vessel-wrap` and cannot be
    configured.

    To see the filesystem in which the game is executing, get the process ID
    of some game process from `ps` and use:

        $ sudo ls -l /proc/$game_pid/root/

    You'll see that the graphics drivers and possibly their dependencies
    are available in `/overrides` inside that filesystem, while selected
    files from the host are visible in `/run/host`.

* To protect `$HOME`, add one of the following options before `--`:

    - `--fake-home=/some/path` (automatically unshares the home directory)
    - `--freedesktop-app-id=com.example.Anything --unshare-home`
    - `--steam-app-id=70 --unshare-home` (when running from Steam you can use `--steam-app-id=${SteamAppId}`)

* To test something manually:

    - cd to the directory that you want to be the current working directory
      inside the container

    - Run:

            /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-wrap -- ./whatever-game

      Optionally add more options before the `--`.

* For interactive testing, if your runtime (if used) or host system (if no
    runtime) contains an xterm binary, you can use something like:

        /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-wrap --xterm -- %command%

    to run an xterm containing an interactive shell. The interactive
    shell's current working directory matches the game's. Run `"$@"` in
    the interactive shell to run the game.

* For interactive testing, if you ran Steam from a shell (not normally
    valid on SteamOS!), you can use:

        /opt/pressure-vessel/bin/pressure-vessel-wrap --interactive -- %command%

    The interactive shell's current working directory matches the game's.
    Run `"$@"` in the interactive shell to run the game.

Use `pressure-vessel-unruntime` if you are in a Steam Runtime environment
(the Steam Runtime's `run.sh` or a Steam game), and `pressure-vessel-wrap`
if you are not ("Add non-Steam game" in Steam, or a non-Steam-related
interactive shell).

Steam integration
-----------------

If a future version of Steam is modified to run certain games using
pressure-vessel, it should remove the Steam Runtime environment variables
from the environment with which it runs them (like it does for
"Add non-Steam game"), and use `pressure-vessel-wrap` directly.
`pressure-vessel-unruntime` is just a workaround for this not
being something that Steam supports yet.

Design constraints
------------------

* Steam games assume that they are executed with the current working
  directory equal to the game's base directory, typically something
  like `SteamApps/common/Half-Life`.

* Steam games are delivered via existing code to use the Steam CDN, not
  as Flatpak packages.

* Each game is assumed to have one subdirectory of `SteamApps`
  (for example `SteamApps/common/Half-Life`) and one
  *AppID* (for example 70 for [Half-Life][]). These are not correlated
  in any obvious way.

  [Half-Life]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/

* Some games have distinct app IDs but share data: for example,
  [X3: Terran Conflict][] (ID 2820) and [X3: Albion Prelude][] (ID 201310)
  share `SteamApps/common/X3 Terran Conflict`.

  [X3: Terran Conflict]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820/X3_Terran_Conflict/
  [X3: Albion Prelude]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/201310/X3_Albion_Prelude/

* The Steam client and client library need to be able to communicate
  via shared memory and SysV semaphores.

    - â‡’ We must share `/dev/shm`
    - â‡’ We must not unshare the IPC namespace

Assumptions
-----------

* Games may write to their own subdirectories of `SteamApps/common`.

* Games should not see each other's saved games and other private data
  in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` etc.

* X11, Wayland, PulseAudio, D-Bus etc. are assumed to use sockets in
  `/run` (including `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`), `/var` or `/tmp`.

    - X11 uses `/tmp`: OK
    - Wayland uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`: OK
    - The D-Bus system bus always uses `/var/run`: OK
    - The D-Bus session bus uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus` on systems with
      systemd, systemd-logind and the user bus: OK
    - The D-Bus session bus uses abstract Unix sockets on other systems: OK
    - PulseAudio uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on modern systems with systemd: OK
    - PulseAudio uses `/var/run` on SteamOS: OK
    - PulseAudio might not work on non-systemd non-SteamOS machines?

* Games can't see `~/.local/share/fonts`, `~/.fonts`, `~/Music`,
  `~/Desktop`, etc. and this is assumed to be OK.

TODO
----

* Games can currently read each other's static data via `~/.steam/steam`
  and `~/.steam/root`. This could be prevented, if we can define which
  parts of `~/.steam` are considered to be API and which are to be
  masked.

* What paths did PulseAudio historically use? It might not work on
  non-systemd non-SteamOS machines.

* Games like AudioSurf that want to read `~/Music` aren't going to work.
  They'll need some new special-case option analogous to
  Flatpak's `--filesystem=xdg-music:ro`.

Design
------

Each game gets a private home directory in `~/.var/app`, the same as
Flatpak apps do. The name of the private home directory follows the
[naming recommendations from the freedesktop.org Desktop Entry
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#file-naming).
For Steam apps, unless a better name has been specified, the app's
freedesktop.org app ID is based on its Steam AppID, for example
`com.steampowered.App70` for Half-Life.

For the game, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
are set to the `./.config`, `./.local/share` and `./.cache` directories
inside its private home directory, so that well-behaved freedesktop-style
apps will write there, and badly-behaved freedesktop-style apps that
ignore the environment variables and hard-code their default values will
*also* write there.

* Example: [X3: Terran Conflict][] writes to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/EgoSoft/X3TC`
* Example: Mesa writes to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mesa` (assuming
  `$MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DIR` is unset)

`./config`, `./data` and `./cache` in the private home directory are symbolic
links to `.config`, `.local/share` and `.cache` respectively, for better
discoverability and compatibility with Flatpak (which uses those directories in
`~/.var/app` as its usual values for `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` and
`XDG_CACHE_HOME`).

Anything that hard-codes a path relative to `$HOME` (including `.config`,
`.local/share` or `.cache`) will write to the corresponding directory in
`~/.var/app`. This is the same as the behaviour of a Flatpak app with
`--persist=.`.

* Example: [Avorion][] writes to `~/.avorion/` in the container, which is
  `~/.var/app/com.steampowered.App445220/.avorion/` in the real home
  directory

  [Avorion]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/

If more than one game is meant to share a private home directory, then
they need to be run with `--freedesktop-app-id=` or `--steam-app-id=`
to set that up.

* For example, if [X3: Terran Conflict][] and [X3: Albion Prelude][]
  are to share data, they would have to both be run with for example
  `--freedesktop-app-id=com.egosoft.X3TC` or `--steam-app-id=2820`.

The app is not currently made available read-only on `/app` (as it
would be in Flatpak). It could be, if desired.
