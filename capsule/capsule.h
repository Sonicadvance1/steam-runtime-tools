/**
 * capsule_dlmopen:
 * @dso: The name of the DSO to open (cf dlopen()) - eg libGL.so.1
 * @prefix: The location of the foreign tree in which @dso should be found
 * @namespace: Address of an #Lmid_t value (usually %LM_ID_NEWLM)
 * @wrappers: Array of #capsule_item_t used to replace symbols in the namespace
 * @debug: Internal debug flags. Pass 0 here.
 * @exclude: an array of char *, each specfying a DSO not to load
 * @errcode: location in which to store the error code on failure
 * @error: location in which to store an error message on failure
 *
 * Opens @dso (a library) from a filesystem mounted at @prefix into a
 * symbol namespace specified by @namespace, using dlmopen().
 *
 * Any symbols specified in @wrappers will be replaced with the
 * corresponding address from @wrappers (allowing you to replace
 * function definitions inside the namespace with your own).
 * This is normally used to replace calls from inside the namespace to
 * dlopen() (which would cause a segfault) with calls to dlmopen().
 *
 * The #Lmid_t valu addressed by @namespace should normally include
 * %LM_ID_NEWLM to create a new namespace. The actual namespace used
 * will be stored in @namespace after a successful call.
 *
 * If a value other than %LM_ID_NEWLM was passed in via @namespace it
 * is not expected to change (and a change would indicate a bug or
 * undefined behaviour).
 *
 * In addition to a bare libFOO.so.X style name, @dso may be an
 * absolute path (or even a relative one) and in those cases should
 * have the same effect as passing those values to dlopen(). This is
 * not a normal use case though, and has not been heavily tested.
 *
 * An empty ("") or void (%NULL) @prefix is equivalent to "/".
