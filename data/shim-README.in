This is a libcapsule based proxy library.

Its purpose is to allow a library (@TARGET@) to be loaded from a
foreign filesystem tree (usually /host, but configurable at compile
time) without exposing any other libraries from that tree to the
program using it.

You can export the symbols of more than one library via the proxy:
To do so, add a line containing the SONAME (libFOO.so.X)
of each extra library to shim/@TARGET@.c.shared and rebuild.

You can also prevent a library from the foreign tree from being loaded
at all (at least as a result of being a dependency of @TARGET@).
To achieve this, add a line containing the SONAME (libFOO.so.X)
of the excluded library to shim/@TARGET@.c.excluded and rebuild.

The generated library will have the same name as the main proxy target
(@TARGET@). You can control the exact version number (cf libfoo.x.y.z)
by setting CAPSULE_VERSION_@AMTARGET@ in Makefile.am

If libcapsule's standard implementation of dlopen() for callers inside
the capsule is not suitable, copy capsule/_int_dlopen.h from
libcapsule's development files into shim/capsule/, modify it as
necessary, and add it to EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am.
