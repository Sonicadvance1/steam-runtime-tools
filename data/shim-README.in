This is a libcapsule based proxy library.

Its purpose is to allow a library (@TARGET@) to be loaded from a
foreign filesystem tree (@TREE@) without exposing any other libraries
from that tree to the program using it.

You can export the symbols of more than one library via the proxy:
To do so, add a line containing the SONAME (libFOO.so.X)
of each extra library to shim/lib@LIB@.so.c.shared and rebuild.

You can also prevent a library from the foreign tree from being loaded
at all (at least as a result of being a dependency of @TARGET@).
To achieve this, add a line containing the SONAME (libFOO.so.X)
of the excluded library to shim/lib@LIB@.so.c.excluded and rebuild.

The generated library will have the same name as the main proxy target
(@TARGET@). You can control the exact version number (cf libfoo.x.y.z)
by setting CAPSULE_VERSION in Makefile.am
